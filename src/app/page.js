                <h2>What is Carboon Footprint?</h2>
                <hr className={styles.line} />
                <p>A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and 
                  methane that are generated by our actions.
                </p>
                <p>The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, 
                  the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2â„ƒ rise in global temperatures, 
                  the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.
                </p>
                <p>Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons doesnt happen overnight! By making small changes to our actions, 
                  like eating less meat, taking fewer connecting flights and line drying our clothes, we can start making a big difference.

                    <p className="mb-4">You can figure out how much your actions affect greenhouse gases by using a carbon footprint calculator. A carbon footprint is the total amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of human activities. Your carbon footprint is the total carbon dioxide released due 
                      to your individual activities. Your households carbon footprint is the total carbon dioxide released by your home and all the people who live there. A carbon footprint calculator typically takes into account the greenhouse gases you produce at home and while traveling. It can also include the greenhouse 
                      gases produced to transport and make the food you eat and the things you buy.
